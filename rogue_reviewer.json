          "content": "<h2>What is Data Poisoning?</h2><p>Data poisoning is a type of cyberattack in which an adversary intentionally compromises a training dataset used by an AI or machine learning (ML) model to influence or manipulate the operation of that model.</p><h3>How is Data Poisoning Done?</h3><ul><li>Intentionally injecting false or misleading information within the training dataset</li><li>Modifying the existing dataset</li><li>Deleting a portion of the dataset</li></ul><p>By manipulating the dataset during the training phase, the adversary can introduce biases, create erroneous outputs, introduce vulnerabilities (i.e., backdoors), or otherwise influence the decision-making or predictive capabilities of the model.</p><h3>Relationship to Adversarial AI</h3><p>Data poisoning falls into a category of cyberattacks known as <strong>adversarial AI</strong>. Adversarial AI or adversarial ML refers to any activity that seeks to inhibit the performance of AI/ML systems by manipulating or misleading them.</p><h2>The Role of Data in Model Training</h2><p>During training, ML models need to access large volumes of data from different sources, known as training data. Common sources for training data include the following:</p><ul><li>The internet, including discussion forums, social media platforms, news sites, blogs, corporate websites, and other publicly published online content.</li><li>Log data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as closed-circuit television footage, video from traffic and surveillance cameras, and geolocation data.</li><li>Government databases, such as Data.gov, which contain environmental and demographic information, among other data types.</li><li>Datasets from scientific publications and studies, encompassing a wide range of fields from biology and chemistry to the social sciences.</li><li>Specialized ML repositories, such as the University of California, Irvine, Machine Learning Repository, which provide broad access to data across multiple subjects.</li><li>Proprietary corporate data, such as customer interactions, sales information, product data, and financial transactions.</li></ul><p>A <strong>data poisoning attack</strong> occurs when threat actors inject malicious or corrupted data into these training datasets, aiming to cause the AI model to produce inaccurate results or degrade its overall performance.</p><h2>Direct vs. Indirect Data Poisoning Attacks</h2><p>Data poisoning attacks can be classified into two categories: direct and indirect attacks.</p><h3>Direct Data Poisoning Attacks</h3><p>These, also referred to as <strong>targeted attacks</strong>, involve manipulating the ML model to behave in a specific way for particular inputs while maintaining the overall performance of the model. The goal is to cause the model to misclassify or misinterpret certain data without degrading its general capabilities.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A facial recognition system trained to identify individuals based on their images. An attacker could inject altered images of a specific person into the training dataset, where these images are subtly modified—like changing hair color or adding accessories. As a result, when the model encounters the actual person in a real-world scenario, it may misidentify them due to these targeted modifications.</p><h3>Indirect Data Poisoning Attacks</h3><p>These attacks, also known as <strong>non-targeted attacks</strong>, aim to degrade the overall performance of the ML model rather than targeting specific functionalities.This type of attack can involve injecting random noise or irrelevant data into the training set, which impairs the model’s ability to generalize.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> A spam detection system trained on a dataset of emails labeled as either spam or not spam. An attacker might introduce a large volume of irrelevant emails—such as random text or unrelated content—into the training set. This influx of noise can confuse the model, leading to a higher rate of false positives and negatives, ultimately reducing its effectiveness.</p>",

          "content": "<h2>Types of Data Poisoning Attacks</h2><p>Data poisoning attacks come in various forms, and adversaries use different strategies to manipulate training data to compromise the integrity and performance of machine learning models. Listed below are five data poisoning attacks that are often considered significant due to their potential impact:</p><h3>1. Label Flipping</h3><p>In this type of attack, adversaries switch the true labels of certain instances in the training set, leading the model to learn incorrect associations. It is a straightforward yet powerful attack that can significantly impact the training process. It can lead to misclassifications and, in some cases, compromise the overall accuracy of the model.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Flip labels of class <code>0</code> to class <code>1</code> in a binary classification dataset to mislead the model.</p><div class='code'>from sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_classes=2, random_state=42)\n\n# Flip 20% of labels from 0 to 1\n = int(0.2 * len(y))\nflip_indices = np.random.choice(np.where(y == 0)[0], num_flip, replace=False)\ny[flip_indices] = 1  # Flip label\n\n# Display flipped labels\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=['Feature 1', 'Feature 2'])\ndf['Label'] = y\nprint(df.head(10))</div><h3>2. Feature Impersonation</h3><p>In this type of attack, adversaries inject instances that mimic features of other classes, causing the model to make incorrect generalizations. Feature impersonation attacks exploit the model’s sensitivity to specific features, leading to confusion and potentially causing the model to make unreliable predictions across various instances.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Inject instances with features similar to class <code>1</code>, but label them as class <code>0</code> to confuse the model.</p><div class='code'># Generate original dataset\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_classes=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,random_state=42)\n\n# Identify centroid of class 1\nclass_1_samples = X[y == 1]\ncentroid = class_1_samples.mean(axis=0)\n\n# Create impersonated samples (label 0, but features like class 1)\nimpersonated_X = centroid + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=(5, 2))\nimpersonated_y = np.zeros(5)  # Wrong label\n\n# Inject impersonated samples into original dataset\nX_poisoned = np.vstack([X, impersonated_X])\ny_poisoned = np.hstack([y, impersonated_y])\n\nprint('Injected Impersonated Samples:')\nprint(pd.DataFrame(impersonated_X, columns=['Feature 1', 'Feature 2']))</div><h3>3. Data Injection</h3><p>In this type of attack, adversaries introduce entirely new instances into the training set, creating synthetic data points. This attack can influence decision boundaries and induce misclassifications on the injected data and is relevant in scenarios where the model needs to generalize well to unseen instances.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Add synthetic, random data points with random labels to alter the model’s decision boundaries.</p><div class='code'># Generate original dataset\nX, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, n_classes=2, random_state=42)\n\n# Inject synthetic (random) data points with random labels\ninjected_X = np.random.uniform(low=-3, high=3, size=(10, 2))\ninjected_y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=10)\n\n# Combine injected data with original\nX_poisoned = np.vstack([X, injected_X])\ny_poisoned = np.hstack([y, injected_y])\n\nprint('Injected Synthetic Data Points:')\nprint(pd.DataFrame(injected_X, columns=['Feature 1', 'Feature 2']))</div>",
